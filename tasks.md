# Football Matches - Tasks

Each of the questions/tasks below can be answered using a `SELECT` query. When you find a solution copy it into the code block under the question before pushing your solution to GitHub.

1) Find all the matches from 2017.

```sql
SELECT * FROM matches WHERE season = 2017;

```

2) Find all the matches featuring Barcelona.

```sql

SELECT * FROM matches WHERE hometeam = 'Barcelona' OR awayteam = 'Barcelona';

```

3) What are the names of the Scottish divisions included?

```sql
<!-- Copy solution here -->
SELECT name FROM divisions WHERE country = 'Scotland';

```

4) Find the division code for the Bundesliga. Use that code to find out how many matches Freiburg have played in the Bundesliga since the data started being collected.

```sql
<!-- Copy solution here -->
SELECT code FROM divisions WHERE name = 'Bundesliga';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches WHERE division_code = 'D1' AND (hometeam = 'Freiburg' OR awayteam = 'Freiburg');


```

5) Find the unique names of the teams which include the word "City" in their name (as entered in the database)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT hometeam FROM matches WHERE hometeam LIKE '%City%' 


```

6) How many different teams have played in matches recorded in a French division?

```sql
-- have to find the division codes for France
SELECT code FROM divisions WHERE country = 'France';

-- use the codes to count the number of different teams
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT hometeam) FROM matches WHERE division_code = 'F1' OR division_code = 'F2';


```

7) Have Huddersfield played Swansea in the period covered?

```sql

SELECT * FROM matches WHERE (hometeam = 'Huddersfield' AND awayteam = 'Swansea') OR (hometeam = 'Swansea' AND awayteam = 'Huddersfield');


```

8) How many draws were there in the Eredivisie between 2010 and 2015?

```sql
<!-- find code for Eredivisie
SELECT code FROM divisions WHERE name = 'Eredivisie';

-- filter result to check Eredivisie division code, where ftr only has draws and season is between 2010 and 2015
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches WHERE (division_code = 'N1' AND ftr = 'D') AND (season >= 2010 AND season <= 2015); 

-- or do SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches WHERE (division_code = 'N1' AND ftr = 'D') AND (season BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015);



```

9) Select the matches played in the Premier League in order of total goals scored from highest to lowest. Where there is a tie the match with more home goals should come first.

```sql
<!-- Copy solution here -->
-- find the division code for premier league
SELECT code FROM divisions WHERE name = 'Premier League'

--
SELECT * FROM matches WHERE division_code = 'E0' ORDER BY (fthg + ftag) DESC;

-- SELECT * FROM matches WHERE division_code = 'E0' ORDER BY (fthg + ftag) fthg DESC;
```

10) In which division and which season were the most goals scored?

```sql
<!-- Copy solution here -->

--answer from review'
SELECT division_code, season, SUM(fthg), SUM(ftag) FROM matches GROUP BY division_code, season ORDER BY SUM(fthg) + SUM(ftag) DESC LIMIT 1;

```
